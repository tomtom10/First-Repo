#A BOY AND HIS DOG

##NOTES

android boy left on a small moon with a habitat for dog breeding. he has been sent there a long time ago (nearly forgotten) by scientists with the long term goal of trying to selectivly evolve the dogs over a very long time. sometimes he must perform seamingly heartless actions in order to stimulate the evolution process but he is always very humane when he has to put down any of the animals. he has a facial tick implanted by the scientists at a very root level in his programming that makes him scowl at random times to intimadate the dogs. he always finds this anoying so he doesn´t pay mutch attention to it. he only has to "sleep" for 6 hours every 2 weeks. he very much percieves things in very long terms. he grows crops to feed the animals and provide oxygen as well. he keeps an eye on the space around him and can track any objects that may be headed towards them from a very long range. 

###self-sustained android managment (S.S.A.M.) 

Boy´s name is Samm-C01. from goverment/science lab genetics/evolution division. it is not certain how many other androids like him are out there. and everything appears to be normal. but earth and all human colonized bodies have been quickly exterminated. only a handful of escape rockets made it off the earth and have been sent to some of these remote bases.
